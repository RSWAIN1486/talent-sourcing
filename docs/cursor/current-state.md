## Replit Deployment Setup (In Progress)

### Completed Tasks:
1. Created new branch `feature/replit-deployment`
2. Added Replit configuration files:
   - Backend: `.replit` and `replit.nix`
   - Frontend: `.replit` and `replit.nix`

### Next Steps:
1. Create two separate Repls on Replit:
   - Backend API Repl
   - Frontend Next.js Repl
2. Import the respective code into each Repl
3. Set up environment variables
4. Configure CORS for the new domains
5. Test the deployment

### Pending:
- Backend deployment and testing
- Frontend deployment and testing
- Integration testing between services
- DNS and HTTPS verification

## Current Tasks - Voice Agent Integration

### Task Overview
Integrating the Voice Agent functionality into the Recruitment AI application to enable automated phone screening of candidates.

### Status
- [x] Initial analysis of existing codebase
- [x] Exploration of Voice Agent repository
- [x] Documentation of feature design
- [x] Backend implementation
  - [x] Set up environment variables
  - [x] Create voice screening endpoint
  - [x] Implement webhook for call results
  - [x] Update candidate model
  - [x] Replace mock implementation with actual API calls
- [x] Frontend implementation
  - [x] Update Call button in JobDetails page
  - [x] Add status indicators for call progress
  - [x] Implement state management for call results
- [ ] Testing
  - [x] Create unit tests for phone number formatting
  - [x] Create unit tests for voice screening service
  - [x] Create integration tests for API endpoints
  - [ ] End-to-end testing with real credentials

### Implementation Notes
- Created a new feature branch `feature/voice-agent-integration`
- Added new endpoints for voice screening and webhook callback
- Implemented actual API calls to Twilio and Ultravox services
- Enhanced candidate model with fields for call results
- Updated frontend to display call status and results
- Added proper phone number formatting function
- Created comprehensive unit and integration tests for the new functionality
- Added detailed error handling for API interactions

### Next Steps
1. Complete end-to-end testing with real Twilio and Ultravox credentials
2. Add more robust phone number validation using a dedicated library
3. Implement detailed logging for call events and debugging
4. Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
5. Create monitoring dashboard for active calls

### Requirements for Full Implementation
- Twilio account with phone number purchased
- Ultravox API account with sufficient credits
- Publicly accessible webhook URL (ngrok for local development or a deployed URL in production)
- Update environment variables with actual credentials
