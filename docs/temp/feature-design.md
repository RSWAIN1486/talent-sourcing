# Deployment and Docker Configuration

## Docker Setup
The application has been containerized using Docker with a multi-container setup using docker-compose. This setup includes:

1. Frontend Container (Next.js):
   - Base image: node:18-alpine
   - Exposed port: 3000
   - Environment variables:
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Points to backend service

2. Backend Container (FastAPI):
   - Base image: python:3.9-slim
   - Exposed port: 8000
   - Environment variables:
     - CORS_ORIGINS: Allowed origins for CORS
     - DEEP_INFRA_API_TOKEN: API token for Deep Infra

## Deployment Options

### Recommended Platforms (Cost-Effective):

1. Railway.app
   - Free tier available
   - Supports Docker deployments
   - Easy GitHub integration
   - Good for full-stack applications

2. DigitalOcean
   - Basic droplet from $4/month
   - Full infrastructure control
   - Native Docker support

3. Render
   - Free tier available
   - Docker support
   - Simple deployment process

4. Fly.io
   - Generous free tier
   - Global deployment
   - Docker-native platform

## Local Development with Docker

To run the application locally using Docker:

1. Create a `.env` file with required environment variables
2. Build and start containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000

## Production Deployment Steps

1. Choose a deployment platform
2. Set up environment variables
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline if needed
4. Deploy Docker containers
5. Set up monitoring and logging 

## Deployment Alternatives Analysis

### Replit Evaluation
- Provides automatic HTTPS with subdomain (your-app.repl.co)
- No manual SSL certificate management needed
- No known HTTPS/HTTP routing issues
- Limitations:
  - Cold starts on free tier
  - Memory limitations (500MB-2GB)
  - Requires keeping repl "alive"
  - Potential reliability concerns

### AWS Alternative
- Most flexible and scalable
- Services to consider:
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - AWS EC2 + RDS
  - AWS Amplify
- Benefits:
  - Complete infrastructure control
  - Robust security features
  - Extensive free tier
  - No routing issues

### GCP Alternative
- Similar to AWS capabilities
- Services to consider:
  - Google App Engine
  - Google Cloud Run
  - Google Compute Engine
- Benefits:
  - Strong performance
  - Good documentation
  - Free tier available
  - Built-in security features

### Recommendation
Based on the application requirements and the HTTPS routing issues faced with Render:

1. If seeking a quick solution: Try Replit first as it handles HTTPS automatically
2. For production-grade deployment: 
   - AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google App Engine for managed services
   - AWS EC2 or Google Compute Engine for full control
